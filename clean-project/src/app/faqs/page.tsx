If you\'re adding major appliances or renovating, an upgrade may also be necessary to handle the increased load.'

        question: 'How quickly can you respond to service calls?',
        answer: 'We typically respond to service calls within 24-48 hours for non-emergency situations. For emergency services, we aim to have a technician on-site as quickly as possible, often within hours.'

      },
      {
        question: 'How efficient are heat pumps compared to traditional heating systems?',
